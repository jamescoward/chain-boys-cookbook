## Notes
- If you don't have a pressure cooker just cook the beans and lentils another way

## Ingredients 

- 1 cup green Lentils (Lentilles Vertes)
- 1/2 cup dried Kidney Beans
- 2 Bayleaves
- 1 Cinnamon Stick
- 3-4 Cardamom Pods
- 3-4 Cloves
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped Ginger
- 8 Garlic Cloves (finely chopped or minced)
- 2 Green Chillies (slit lengthwise)
- 1 tablespoon Coriander Powder
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric Powder
- 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder
- Vegetable Oil
- 12 Salad Tomatoes (diced)
- 2-3 Onions (diced)
- 2 tablespoons Butter
- Garam Masala Powder to taste (around 1-2 teaspoons is a good start)
- Salt to taste
- some cream

## Method

1. Cook the lentils and kidney beans in a pressure cooker (around 20 minutes quick release). Mash them a bit once they're cooked
2. In a dry pan toast all the spices except the Garam Masala for a bit, be careful it doesn't burn though
3. Add some oil to the spices and then the onions and cook them over a lowish heat until they are soft
4. Add the tomatoes and cook then for a bit
5. Add in the cooked lentils and beans and the butter
6. Simmer for a couple hours stirring occasionally so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, add some water if it is too thick
7. Add salt and Garam Masala to taste.
8. Stir in the cream and server
